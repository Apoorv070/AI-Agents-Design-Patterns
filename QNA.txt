QQ: Framework Selection: You are tasked with building a RAG-heavy compliance bot for a bank. The system must provide a strict audit trail and allow for "checkpointing" if a query takes too long. Compare LangGraph and AutoGen for this specific use case. Which framework would you choose and why?

ANS : For a RAG-heavy banking compliance bot that requires strict audit trail + checkpointing, I would choose LangGraph over AutoGen. LangGraph is designed for stateful, deterministic workflows, where every step (retrieval, reasoning, decision) is stored in a structured state graph — making full auditability and traceability much easier, which is critical in banking. It also natively supports checkpointing and resumability, so long-running queries can pause, recover, or restart safely without losing progress. In contrast, AutoGen is more flexible for conversational multi-agent collaboration but is less deterministic and harder to audit rigorously, which can be a risk for regulated environments. Therefore, LangGraph is the better fit for compliance, control, and reliability.

QQ: Optimization Trade-offs: Discuss the "Coordination Tax" in the context of a 50-agent
swarm versus a 3-agent hierarchical crew. In which scenario is "information
fragmentation" more likely to occur, and how would you use a "supervisor agent" to
minimize this tax?

ANS: Coordination Tax is the overhead cost (communication, synchronization, conflict resolution, state sharing) required to make multiple agents work together effectively. As the number of agents increases, this tax grows non-linearly.

In a 50-agent swarm, coordination tax is very high because many agents operate in parallel, exchange partial information, and may duplicate work or act on inconsistent state. This makes information fragmentation much more likely — knowledge gets scattered across agents, some agents act on outdated context, and global coherence weakens. In contrast, a 3-agent hierarchical crew has lower coordination tax since communication paths are fewer and more structured, reducing fragmentation risk.

To minimize coordination tax in the swarm, introduce a Supervisor Agent that:

Maintains a shared global state / memory

Aggregates partial outputs from agents

Resolves conflicts and removes duplicate work

Assigns tasks based on current system view

Enforces communication rules (who talks to whom)

Periodically re-synchronizes agents to prevent drift

This converts chaotic many-to-many coordination into structured hub-and-spoke coordination, reducing fragmentation, improving consistency, and lowering overall coordination overhead.
