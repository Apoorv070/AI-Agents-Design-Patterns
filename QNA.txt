QQ: Framework Selection: You are tasked with building a RAG-heavy compliance bot for a bank. The system must provide a strict audit trail and allow for "checkpointing" if a query takes too long. Compare LangGraph and AutoGen for this specific use case. Which framework would you choose and why?

ANS : For a RAG-heavy banking compliance bot that requires strict audit trail + checkpointing, I would choose LangGraph over AutoGen. LangGraph is designed for stateful, deterministic workflows, where every step (retrieval, reasoning, decision) is stored in a structured state graph — making full auditability and traceability much easier, which is critical in banking. It also natively supports checkpointing and resumability, so long-running queries can pause, recover, or restart safely without losing progress. In contrast, AutoGen is more flexible for conversational multi-agent collaboration but is less deterministic and harder to audit rigorously, which can be a risk for regulated environments. Therefore, LangGraph is the better fit for compliance, control, and reliability.

ANS: For a RAG-heavy compliance bot in a regulated banking environment, LangGraph is the better choice. It is built around stateful, deterministic workflows, which makes it easier to maintain a clear audit trail of every step (retrieval, reasoning, decisions) — a critical requirement for compliance. LangGraph also supports checkpointing and resumability, allowing long-running queries to pause and safely continue without losing state. In comparison, AutoGen is more flexible for open-ended multi-agent conversations but is less deterministic and harder to strictly audit, which can be risky for compliance-sensitive systems. Hence, LangGraph provides stronger control, traceability, and reliability for this use case.
